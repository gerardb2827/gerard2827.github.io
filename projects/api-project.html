            <h1 class="margin text-center">Fulton Mall API</h1>
            <p>This is my API project. By going into <a href = "https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us/">NYC Open Source Database</a>, I was able to pull from a selection of different sources. For this project I pulled from the, <a href="https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Business/Fulton-Street-Mall-businesses/jvce-szsb"><b>Fulton Street Mall businesses.</b></a>There were many different objects that I could have used from the set, but I only used the stores, and the type of product sold. With these 2 labels I made a search loop, where you will type in a number, and it brings you to that store. The number corresponds to the 40 different store categories, and the store that pops up would be a store that sells that type of product.</p>
            <p>I faced many challenges attempting to do this project. One of the biggest challenges was for me to make the store show based off of the category selected. I spent a lot of time trying to figure out how my loop or if statement should be if I wanted to do that task. After a day the code just came to me, and I was able to make the if statement, after a few trials. However the if statement was only partially working. Using the numbers to search for a store was not working, and I assume it’s because of the different data types. The numbers being an integer but the store is a string.When you type in the number it would give the store type correctly, but give back ‘undefined’ for the store.  When you manually type in the store category into the if statement the code works fine and it will properly give back the corresponding store.</p>
            <p>My next steps moving forward is definitely going to be trying out different methods to get the code to work properly. I’m not sure exactly what is wrong with it, but tinkering around with it, I’m sure I’ll fix it. I also would like to add a drop down menu by store category, or a search bar, to this project. That would be more user friendly, because they would be able to see the category they are choosing instead of blindly picking with a random number. It would also allow for quicker searching, in case they would like to go for multiple stores.</p>
